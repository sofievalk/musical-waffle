Humans need about 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night. Sleep habits are heritable, associated with brain function and 
structure, and intrinsically related to well-being, mental and physical health. This raises the question whether 
associations between sleep, mental and physical health can be attributed to a shared macroscale neurobiology.
Combining neuroimaging and behavioral genetic approaches in two independent large-scale datasets (HCP (n=1106) 
age range 22â€“37, eNKI (n=783) age range 12-85), we demonstrate phenotypic and genetic correspondence between 
sleep, intelligence, and BMI. Sleep was associated with local thickness variation in frontal, temporal, and 
occipital cortices. Using a comprehensive multivariate approach, we identified two robust latent components 
highlighting the interdigitation of sleep, intelligence, BMI, and depression and their shared relation to regions 
in unimodal and heteromodal association cortices. Latent relationships were heritable and driven by shared additive 
genetic factors. These observations provide a system-level perspective on the interrelation of sleep, mental, 
and physical conditions, anchored in grey-matter neuroanatomy.
